I became interested in software development in the fall of 2016 in the first year of the direction "Applied Mathematics and Computer Science" of Engineering Academy of RUDN. The university course gave me a good algorithmic base and basic skills of system programming in C / C ++.

My career in IT began in January 2017 in the Group of Companies [DA-strategy] (https://da-strateg.ru), where I worked with the MERN stack.

I was also interested in the field of artificial intelligence. I mastered the necessary tools for collecting, analyzing and visualizing data in Python and studied both classical models of machine learning and deep learning.

In May 2018, I joined the [Time2Chain](https://t2ch.github.io/) development team, where I was designing overlay peer-to-peer network for open blockchain platform, writing related services (block explorer, console and web interfaces). Working on this project has given me invaluable experience in developing decentralized applications.

In February 2019, I opened own IT outsourcing company.

At the moment, I am combining the main activity with the post of consulting chief technology officer at "Astana" LLC and writing a bachelorâ€™s diploma.

In my free time from study and work, I like reading and bouldering.
